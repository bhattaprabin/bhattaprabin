               I have 3.5 years of experience in web development. I have worked on several projects including government projects.<br><br>
                Because I need to travel to the UK for my Master's degree, there is a break in my working career. I therefore quit my job and moved here, however I continued to code while working on my final year project on ASP.Net, EntityFramework and SQL database as well as I am now learning Python Programming.<br><br>
                I earned my master's degree. I'm currently searching for any programming positions to resume my career. As I can take things up quickly and pick them up quickly, and because I have relevant experience, the company I will be working with don't need to spend time and effort training me, I am certain that I can contribute value to the team.
